WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: Erik Pombeiro Dias
Date: 05/02/2026

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: String values with inconsistent formatting

Which tutorial provides the solution: [strings]

Which variable(s) affected: [site,treatment]

Why this is important to fix: [Biological/analytical reason]
Causes analytical problems as it causes data in the same categories to appear separate

What I plan to do: [The technique I'll use, in plain English]
Using conditional changes, case_when, to replace the strings to consistent values


ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [What's the problem? 1 sentence]
Numeric issues, values are negative when it is impossible

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial name/number]

Which variable(s) affected: [numeric consistency]

Why this is important to fix: [Biological/analytical reason]
Biologically is impossible, and causes issues in analysis

What I plan to do: [The technique I'll use, in plain English]
Flip the values to positive.


OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
