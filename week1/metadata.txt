PESTICIDE EFFECTS ON MOSQUITO EGG-LAYING BEHAVIOR
================================================

STUDY CONTEXT:
--------------
Testing effectiveness of pesticide-treated egg-laying traps for pest 
management. Females exposed to treated traps show reduced reproduction 
through two mechanisms:

1. BEHAVIORAL AVOIDANCE: Females detect pesticide and lay fewer eggs
2. DIRECT TOXICITY: Pesticide residues reduce egg viability/hatching

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
-------------------
Study Period: May 1, 2023 - August 31, 2023
Sites: Three agricultural field sites
  - Site A 
  - Site B 
  - Site C 

Treatments (n=~37-38 per treatment):
  - Control: No pesticide in traps
  - Low_dose: 0.5% active ingredient
  - Medium_dose: 1.0% active ingredient
  - High_dose: 2.0% active ingredient

VARIABLES:
----------
female_id: Unique identifier for each female insect
  - Type: Integer
  - Should be unique unless repeated measures (weekly sampling)

treatment: Pesticide concentration in egg-laying trap
  - Type: Categorical
  - Levels: Control, Low_dose, Medium_dose, High_dose

age_days: Age of female at collection (days post-emergence as adult)
  - Type: Integer
  - Normal range: 20-90 days
  - Younger females (<30 days) produce fewer eggs naturally

body_mass_mg: Female body mass in milligrams
  - Type: Numeric (continuous)
  - Normal range: 50-130 mg
  - Varies by site 
  - Correlates with egg production capacity

eggs_laid: Total number of eggs laid by female
  - Type: Integer (count)
  - Expected dose-response:
    * Control: 50-70 eggs (baseline)
    * Low_dose: reduction 
    * Medium_dose: reduction (strong avoidance)
    * High_dose: reduction (strong avoidance + physiological stress)
  - Also affected by age, body mass, and site conditions

eggs_hatched: Number of eggs that successfully hatched
  - Type: Integer (count)

collection_date: Date of data collection
  - Type: Date
  - Range: 2023-05-01 to 2023-08-31

collector: Person who collected data
  - Type: Categorical
  - Levels: Smith, Jones, Garcia

site: Field site location
  - Type: Categorical  
  - Levels: Site_A, Site_B, Site_C
