TUTORIAL 1: CHECKING STRINGS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ ] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any string-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x] YES - Question #(s): 2,5
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 4


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [ ] str_to_lower() - standardize capitalization
   [ ] str_to_upper() - standardize capitalization  
   [ ] str_trim() - remove leading/trailing whitespace
   [ ] str_replace() - fix typos or inconsistent spellings
   [x] Other: case_when() / mutate()
   [ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: mutate(site = casewhen())
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - Site c
   - Site-B
   - site_a
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - Site A
   - Site B
   - Site C


4. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not? (Check all that apply)
   [ ] I don't have any character/text variables
   [ ] My text variables are already clean
   [ ] My string issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 2: CHECKING DATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ ] I completed the tutorial exercises



CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any date-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x] YES - Question #(s): 1
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 5


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [ ] dmy() / ymd() / mdy() - parse dates in different formats
   [ ] excel_numeric_to_date() - convert Excel serial numbers
   [ ] Checking for impossible dates (wrong day/month/year)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [x] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: filter()
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - 
   - 
   - 
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - 
   - 
   - 


4. Think about consequences:

   What assumption am I making about date format?
   (e.g., "01/12/2023 is DD/MM/YYYY not MM/DD/YYYY")
   
   
   What could go wrong if this assumption is incorrect?
   
   
   How could I verify my assumption is correct?
   


5. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not?
   [ ] I don't have any date variables
   [ ] My dates are already in proper format
   [ ] My date issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ___________


================================================================================
CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any missing data questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x] YES - Question #(s): 3
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway (missing data is common)


2. Which variables have the most missing data?

   Variable: body_mass_mg | Percent missing: 7.32%
   Variable: eggs_laid | Percent missing: 7.80%
   Variable: eggs_hatched | Percent missing: 8.29%


3. Missingness types checklist


   [x] MCAR (Missing Completely At Random) - appears random/scattered
   [ ] MAR (Missing At Random) - related to other observed variables
   [ ] MNAR (Missing Not At Random) - related to the missing value itself

Why is it important to know what type of missing data we have? 
It can reveal issues with data collection, equipent issues or relationships
with missing variables
